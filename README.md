Productivity & Reward Tracker (PERN Stack)

A full-stack PERN (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js) application focused on task completion and behavioural reinforcement.

Users can securely sign up and log in, then create, edit, and delete tasks with custom effort values. Completing tasks awards Effort Points, which can be spent on user-defined “Wants”, introducing a reward loop that encourages consistency and follow-through.

The application blends productivity tooling with light gamification mechanics, using effort-based scoring to reinforce motivation without relying on external social features.
